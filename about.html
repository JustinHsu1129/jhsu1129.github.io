		<h2>About Justin</h2>
		<div class = "one-half first">
			<p>I am a 4th year electrical engineering major at UC Davis focusing on physical design and VLSI. I have been working on many projects to deepen my understanding of physical design. I have been taking advantage of open-source tools like OpenLane2, as well as utilizing my school's computer lab to learn Synopsys' Design Compiler and their suite of IC design tools. I have been studying the fantastic Digital VLSI Design (RTL to GDS) lectures posted by Professor Adam Teman, and implementing the techniques he describes in my designs.</p><br>
			<p>During my time interning at Lotus Communication Systems for two years, I have gained invaluable professional and communication skills. Working on complex projects with a team of 6-7 people highlighted the importance of effective communication and teamwork to me. As a result, the docmentation I wrote supporting my designs and reports I presented prioritized a succinct structure that clearly conveyed my message and the graphs and data I included were portrayed in a easy to comprehend manner. </p><br>
			<p>In my four years at UC Davis, I have taken many electrical engineering classes. I have prioritized taking classes in the digital realm-particularly ones that involve circuit/physical design. However, I tried to select a wide range of classes that I thought would give me a holistic understanding of physical design. As a result, I believe the following list of classes I have selected reflects my priorities:</p>
			<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
				<li>EEC 116 - VLSI Design<i> (planned)</i></li>
				<li>EEC 118 - Digital IC Design</li>
				<li>EEC 170 - Computer Architecture</li>
				<li>EEC 180 - Digital Systems II</li>
				<li>EEC 216 - Low Power Digital IC Design <i>(planned)</i></li>
				<li>EEC 283 - Advanced Digital Verification Techniques</li>
				<li>EEC 289O - IC Design and Tapeout <i>(planned)</i></li>
				<li>EEC 289Q - Deep Learning Hardware Design <i>(planned)</i></li>
			</ul>
