Designed and laid out a high performance 8 bit barrel shifter and a support 3-to-8 decoder using Cadence Virtuoso. The project involved the full custom physical design flow, from schematic capture and transistor level simulation to manual layout and physical verification.

I performed manual cell-level layout, focusing on symmetrical routing optimal transistor sizing, and efficient area utilization to minimize parasitics and ensure functionality.

Verified timing and logical functionality using Cadence Spectre, performing corner analysis to ensure robust performance across various voltage and temperature conditions.

Achieved physical verification closure by passing all DRC, LVS, and antenna checks.
